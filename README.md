# ELCA Challenge PolyHACK 2020

## Title
Traffic optimization with real-time simulation

## Short Description
As the people and vehicle density in the city continuously grows, traffic optimizations are getting more and more important.
In this challenge, you will try to optimize a traffic problem with new ways with the help of a simulator.

## Long Description

### Background
With the growing population, traffic management is getting more and more important, especially in cities. To evaluate new possibilities and test them, sophisticated simulations are needed to verify and optimize them.

### Starting Position
We prepared a street network based on the center of Aarhus (Denmark) with simulated car traffic.
In that network, random pedestrians are generated which want to travel from one location to another with public transport.
The simulation can be run with the simulation software SUMO.
You then get a python-based library to interact with the simulation in real time by reading out data or creating and controlling vehicles.

### Challenge
Find out where the pedestrians want to travel.
Generate buses which can fulfill the needs.
Optimize the public transport routes in various ways.
