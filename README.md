## Title
Traffic optimization with real-time simulation

## Short Description
As the people and vehicle density in the city continuously grows, traffic optimizations are getting more and more important.
In this challenge, you will try to optimize a traffic problem with new ways with the help of a simulator.

## Long Description

### Background
With the growing population, traffic management is getting more and more important, especially in cities. To evaluate new possibilities of traffic optimization and test them out, sophisticated simulations are ideal tools to verify or further optimize them.

### Starting Position
We prepared a street network based on the center of Aarhus (Denmark) with simulated car traffic for one day.
In that network, random pedestrians are generated which want to travel from one location to another with public transport.
The simulation will run with the open source simulation software SUMO (created by Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt).
There is a python-based library available to interact with the simulation in real time by reading out data or creating and controlling vehicles.

### Challenge
Read out information from the pedestrians with the given API and find out who wants to travel where.
Generate buses which can fulfill the travel needs of the pedestrians.
Optimize the public transport routes in various ways and try to transport as many pedestrians as possible in the shortest time possible without overloading the traffic.
